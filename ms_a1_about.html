        I graduated from high school in Darwin where I studied mostly STEM subjects and represented the school in math and science competitions. During my time at school
        I also played music performing on Clarinet in the youth orchestras and concert bands. I then went onto university studying Electronic Engineering I dropped at the end of 2nd year to help support my parents.
        I went on to work in electronic retail and started learning sound engineering I eventually pursued a career in corporate AV specialising in Video systems.

        I’ve had many hobbies in addition to being semi professional musician playing clarinet and saxophone, I enjoy boards games, computer games, camping and cooking. 
        The hobby I’m most passionate about is scuba diving. Due to its proximity to Darwin I’ve spent a lot of time underwater off the coast of Bali and Lombok.
        I've also spent a bit of time diving around South Australian costal waters.
